Problem 3: StandardRobot Class
0.0/10.0 points (graded)

Each robot must also have some code that tells it how to move about a room, which will go in a method called updatePositionAndClean.

Ordinarily we would consider putting all the robot's methods in a single class. However, later in this problem set we'll consider robots with alternate movement strategies, to be implemented as different classes with the same interface. These classes will have a different implementation of updatePositionAndClean but are for the most part the same as the original robots. Therefore, we'd like to use inheritance to reduce the amount of duplicated code.

We have already refactored the robot code for you into two classes: the Robot class you completed in Problem 2 (which contains general robot code), and a StandardRobot class that inherits from it (which contains its own movement strategy).

Complete the updatePositionAndClean method of StandardRobot to simulate the motion of the robot after a single time-step (as described on the Simulation Overview page).

We have provided the getNewPosition method of Position, which you may find helpful:

class Position(object):

    def getNewPosition(self, angle, speed):
        """
        Computes and returns the new Position after a single clock-tick has
        passed, with this object as the current position, and with the
        specified angle and speed.

        Does NOT test whether the returned position fits inside the room.

        angle: number representing angle in degrees, 0 <= angle < 360
        speed: positive float representing speed

        Returns: a Position object representing the new position.
        """

Note: You can pass in an integer or a float for the angle parameter.

Before moving on to Problem 4, check that your implementation of StandardRobot works by uncommenting the following line under your implementation of StandardRobot. Make sure that as your robot moves around the room, the tiles it traverses switch colors from gray to white. It should take about a minute for it to clean all the tiles.
